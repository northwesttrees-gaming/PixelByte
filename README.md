# PixelByte
A Minecraft modification that adds computers and computer tech to the game that has uses other than decoration. 
This modification will also support some of my other mods I have made by expanding their features with this mod if the game detects the mod is installed. 
The mods that will be supported are CCTVCraft 2, Real Time Mod and a future mod called CrownEconomy.
